# smartfolds.nvim

> Building smarter folds for Neovim — work in progress! 🛠️

---

**smartfolds.nvim** is an experimental Neovim plugin I'm building to improve how folds display — especially for JavaScript and TypeScript code with JSDoc comments.

Right now, it's very early in development.  
I'm building this project *publicly*, sharing all my progress, learnings, and challenges.

Follow the journey here — contributions, feedback, and encouragement are all welcome!

## 📖 Goal

- Improve folded text to show meaningful information (like a function signature) instead of generic `{...}`.
- Support JavaScript/TypeScript first.
- Eventually expand to other languages and custom fold formats.

---

## 🛠 Current Status

- [x] Repository created
- [x] Basic plugin structure in Lua
- [x] First working version of custom `foldtext`
- [x] Simple function signature detection
- [x] Basic Treesitter integration
- [ ] Improve Treesitter parsing (handle more node types)
- [ ] Add configuration options (like custom fold text formats)
- [ ] Better handling of fillchars and fold formatting
- [ ] Initial documentation
